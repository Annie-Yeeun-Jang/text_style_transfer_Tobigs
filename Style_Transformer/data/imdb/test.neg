every cliche in the book is used , and the low budget assures terrible special effects .
in this case , jcvd is the talent and the only reason anyone is watching this film .
this cinematic failure is littered with cheesy , cliche dialogue that 's worse than angsty teen poetry .

the cinematography looks nice , but that 's not enough to save this tripe .
it 's a five minute skit dragged on for a whole movie .
lacking not only in plot , but the acting is atrocious .
not because the film was funny , but because the film was so very bad .
thirdly , the acting left mind-blowing amounts to be desired - it was appalling , it really was .
some competent acting talent was squandered .
after about 30 minutes i stopped the movie , went on-line to see how many minutes this disaster was .
there are actually a handful of great lines of dialogue but for the most part its awkward and weak .

if you wish to have a truly traumatic experience , than this awful motion picture is for you .
a mostly uninteresting and forgettable , but not awful , and sometimes entertaining , rendition of the tale .
3/10 for the good acting .
if you remember them in the 40s and than watch this , you 'll probably become extremely depressed .
the staging , color coordination and whatever else went into making this movie was alienating at best .
terribly scripted dialogue delivered by brain-dead actors , a ridiculous plot and a predictable twist .
i give this nonsense a 2 instead of a 1 because there is a worse show called haunted homes .
the plot just creeps along , not giving us a lot of suspense .
chevy chase is dull and amazingly unfunny .
the competition for the worst warner bros kay francis movie is stiff .

this one is definitely one for my `` worst movies ever '' list .

it was tedious , boring and , amazingly , full of bad language , unlike its predecessor movies .

first off , the mistakes that they made with the movie .
i did n't make it to the end so i will give this a 3 .

the rest of the characters are , well , uninspired , and purely the invention of the screenwriters .
this movie is the worst movie i have ever seen .

never have i seen a movie that is so dull , poorly acted , and incoherent .
staring the biggest -- most talentless -- show offs that ever went before the camera .
this anime greatly disappointed me because it removed the comedy and high quality action of the manga and ova .
that 's not necessarily bad in itself , but there 's nothing to make up for the barren settings .
i only give it a 2 , because of lana 's presence in it .
but his performance in this case is plain stupid , both with respect the lines uttered and the acting .
trying to build too much with very little , this film and its evil predictable villain is just lame .

i must say that i was truly disappointed , not because of the music but the movie in itself .
i feel sorry for whoever has the misfortune to get roped into seeing this : cliched and dull .
the plot was convoluted to the point of not being able to follow what was going on .
nothing really exciting happens and the few action scenes seem to have been shot by someone in a trance .
you simply do n't care about the plot , the actors but you will hate the awful muzak .
the only reason i gave it a 3 was because the graphics were semi charming .
i hate to criticize a film made in 1943 , but this is really a big disappointment .

awful , awful , awful - from screenplay to casting to effects .
after seeing 2 minutes of this episode i was utterly utterly disappointed and ashamed .
my overall grade is a 3/10 .
..but unfortunately no one thought about having van killed in order to save this doomed production .
a few memorable , gruesome bits ca n't compensate for a really poor script .
all in all , a very bad made for tv movie experience .
the character of the has-been playwright seemed pointless altogether , and wholly predictable .
nicky katt was the best actor in this mess .
her character is n't likable at all much less funny or anything else .

i think the best acting was performed by salman and priyanka overall , i think its an alright movie !
i usually let that slide , but here it just goes too far .
the only solace i could find in this really was the intensity that was built up at various points .
the characters act without motivation of any kind .
julia stiles comes off as a rank amateur ; the cringe factor in her readings is off the meter .

all i can say about this movie , is it is absolutely boring .
it was like watching the family stone minus the funny improvisational parts and extending the bad hollywood movie parts .
i actually want my 27 minutes back of my life that i spent watching this piece of crap .

the action sequences are nothing special or exciting , but confusing .
i 'm a huge randolph scott fan , but this film is a dud .
first off , the construction of the screenplay and editing was utterly atrocious , even by horror movie standards .

an awful awful movie .
just do n't watch this film .

i like zombie movies , and i like japanese movies , but this one was just too amateurish .
characterization is thin at best , no thanks to weak dialogue and soporific direction .
the special effects were second-rate at best , with obvious seams visible and cgi clearly recognizable .
but , despite good acting by robert young and eve arden , the movie is a mess .
there 's no tension and the storyline is extremely thin .
do n't ever pick this up .
this movie pretends to be insightful but it 's not .
there were some shots that stood out , but over all there were nothing exiting about the cinematography .
one of the worst theatrical movies of the year , if not all time .
watching the main character walk around endlessly without saying or doing anything is just garbage film-making .
she a very pretty woman , but as an actress , she consistently sub-par .
all style and no substance .
i give this movie a 4 cause i 'm a die hard fan of the video game series .
the imagery is n't all that colorful , either , certainly not matching dario 's worst movies .
this must be one of the worst movies ever made in recent history .
there is nothing else worth to say about this movie .
the special effects have no effect whatsoever - except inducing complete disbelief .
i vote a 2 only because ralph looked so stunning .
the writing was terrible , the animation was terrible , and by anime standards this is just awful .
this film must break some record for worst written and delivered lines .
total waste of time .
the idea is actually great but the execution is sorely lacking in every aspect .
never see this movie .
what could have been a great movie for all actors , turned out to be a b-movie at best .
the movie 's other redeeming quality is eastwood 's direction .
while i could go on about the chases and how they ruin a decent story , i wo n't .
whenever disney characters reach adulthood these days they become either obnoxious or just plain boring .
but you have to fork over money one way or another to see this turkey .
what could have been an interesting idea was spoilt by the lack of any character development .
yeah , rat race has its moments , but a great deal of it irritated me .
this is a bad , bad attempt at a smart drama .
cast of really obnoxious teens and profane adults could n't die fast enough as far as i was concerned .
my word of advice for wary b-movie fans is if it says olen ray stay away !
in other words , do n't waste your time watching this .
this film is very boring and so long .
some people can make fascinating movies without real action , but not this one .
the acting was horrible , i 'm surprised dennis could even get a career after this .
bad drama composition is worst about this film as plot on killing hitler suppose to be pretty dramatic event .
very little of this movie feels real , it feels like play someone was staging on saturday afternoon .
the movie is boring , long , and devoid of believable characters or situations .
this movie has an interesting enough story , but it plays out very bad here .
in `` hobgoblins '' i hated the actors ... and everyone else involved in creating this atrocity .
then we have richard widmark who has the most ludicrously written part in the picture !
gina 's great , but not even she could save this one .
this movie is just so awful , and the songs in this are terrible !
even sandra looked like hell , positively fat .
even a cast featuring john travolta and lisa kudrow could not make this picture worth seeing .
i realized there were humorous parts , but i did n't laugh .
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen .
truly , a man born in the wrong century .
this film has to be one of the worst produced in 1981 .
bottom line : this movie sucked from opening propaganda to final stunt .
any government that could let gary collins live through an entire movie just has to be full of idiots .
big bad wolf is another in a long line of attempts to make a good werewolf movie .
i gave it a 2 for a three reasons : 1 .
bad points of film : irrelevant scenes , boring , lacks in horror genre .
the characters are completely one-dimensional and have no motivation for anything they do .
if the flick has anything at all going for it , it 's b-movie diva rubin 's even performance .
the first 20 to 30 minutes is bearable then this movie is like a drag !
and the cockpit voice recording that was miraculously found , it was totally useless for establishing what happened .
the overall movie itself is utterly boring , and hardly funny at all .
like our poor , but beautiful protagonist , i felt used , dirty , cheap ... .
filled with references glorifying evil , and an annoying soundtrack it 's sure to rub hundreds the wrong way .
this may have been the single worst large studio production i have ever seen .
yes kids like 8 to 10 might enjoy but its really stupid .
being passionate about cinema and world cinema in particular , i walked away incredibly frustrated .
and a mysterious fog and the mysterious disappearance of millions of mexicans is a stupid , childish joke .
shameless waste of my time as a viewer .
bad acting , i 'm sorry to say , did not help to enjoy this rather sticky screenplay .
the writing was bland .
not only was the plot was difficult to follow , but it seems character development was randomly applied .
this is recommended only if you really feel like watching a bad old school movie .
this was the 2nd worst movie i have seen to date .
the story may have been original , but the direction sure was n't .
this movie is not worth seeing , at least not at a cinema .
the villains in the movie do not seem the slightest bit scary .
i believe i smiled once or twice at a couple cute lines , but that 's it .
hide and creep is by far one of the all time worst films ever made .
it 's one redeeming feature is that the very lovely diane franklin is on screen for most of the film
this film is by one of the worst movies i have seen this year .
i wanted to see an action comedy with a satirical twist but this one failed me miserably .
i actually disliked the leading characters so much that their antics were never funny but pathetic .
you wo n't even get any laughs out of the utter ineptitude on display ... trust me .
chris pine fights to keep himself above the surface whilst being drowned by a misery of a lightweight cast .
how could such tasteless , extremely unfunny drivel come from such a pool of apparent talent ! !
mos def ruined the movie all on his own , but willis did n't really do anything stop him .
the lighting is awful .
the whole plot characters , story line , narrative arc goes nowhere .
there are a few good laughs , but it 's very inconsistent .
the captain 's super powers seem to be limited to throwing his shield and faking car sickness .
the actors did n't even seem to be into their parts and seemed quite lifeless and listless .
do n't waste your time .
if you like these , do n't watch this movie .
i like all this movie crew and dark humor movies ; but did n't like this one at all !
gone is the plot , mystery , the dark aspects of the first ... a sham .
so kids do n't waste your cash on this crap buy hostel instead .
the acting is horrendously mediocre , the plot is derivative , with no compelling or appealing characters whatsoever .
why spend more than two hours watching this mess of a film .
do n't waste 2 hours of your life on this .
in retrospect , i wonder why i even gave it a `` 3 '' .
these were older characters and actors doing superficial horny 20-something lives - just sort of annoying and wrong feeling .
considering the talent involved , this has to be one of the worst movies i 've ever seen .
so what i 'm going to do is list the top five things wrong with this film 1 .
this movie is a slap in the face to anyone who payed money for this .
what little dialogue there is in the movie is as inane and nonsensical as the images .
project kill is the worst movie i have ever seen .
from a cinematic point of view it is probably one of the worst films i have encountered absolutely dire .
horror nor gore approaches that of robocop 2 and the effects are ... missing .
final rating : 1/10 i wish i could give it a zero .
i would not recommend this movie to anyone .
the plot is ridiculous , the acting pretty much non-existent - then again , ninja ca n't act !
the story is cloying , insulting and stupid , as might be expected for a movie in this genre .
however , in step brothers it is not funny , just depressing , mean-spirited and reprehensible .
i also found the lord fenton absolutely appalling and i did not like his character .
subplot with the corporate law firm was a complete waste of time .
if you like and are intrigued by good films , stay clear of this turkey .
and i repeat , please do not see this movie !
other than some pretty good special effects , and set designs , nothing about descent is worthwhile .
no emotion , no real sense of direction , and a whole ton of intense swearing .
the story is contrived with sub-plots that add nothing to the narrative .
i love that scene , but the movie is a very bad movie .
the only time the movie has any energy or humor is when frank morgan is on camera .
i would rather be stretched on the rack than sit through this atrocity again .
unfortunately , there 's very little else to recommend this seasonal stinker .
everything that could possibly go wrong actually features here in this lame horror vehicle .
evie , especially , is one of the most unsympathetic characters you 'll meet in a film this year .
the casting did nothing but increase the cheese factor exponentially , i 'm afraid .
it could have ended 3 different places but it just kept going on to a mostly predictable hollywood ending .
not one good thing to say about this crap movie .
this film is probably the worst film that i have ever seen .
4 ) natalie portman has never been in a strip club .
the whole movie it feels like you 're watching a guy trying to hard to impress beyond his abilities .
lack of scares , lack of atmosphere , lack of interesting story .
avoid this at all costs , and add 90 precious minutes to your life .
in spite of everything , i gave this flick a 4 out of 10 .
do some insane stuff and have my adrenaline pumping but these guys ... just scripted stupid reactions .
i do n't say it often , but this film was bad .
a plot that is dumb beyond belief .
the set was way too functional and futuristic for the 22nd century , especially for an old mining ship .
never would i recommend this movie to my worst enemy , yet anybody i actually like .
maybe the worse movie i have ever see .
supposed to be funny , but it 's not .
stephen dorff & reese witherspoon just waste there time & talents in a really wasted script .
avoid this at all costs .
but not only is this film bad in artistic value , it 's incredibly boring .
you want to feel sad or happy or empathetic or something ; you just feel bored .
it completely fails as an addition to both series , and it fails as a film itself .
the plot in the film is unbelievably boring and goes virtually nowhere throughout the film .
this movie i totally not funny , and i would imagine to be pretty offensive to jewish people .
low quality effects , bad actors , and it seems like it 's shot by an amateur camcorder .
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably .
as such , the film 's only real saving grace is the luminous presence of anne hathaway .
it does have a promising premise , but it is done all wrong .
i found nothing in particular to recommend this one .
it may list as 111 minutes but feels like three hours of painfully wasted time .
this movie is so bad and so frustrating that i just had to do it .
second i find the hoffmann character not that convincing anymore after his `` accident '' .
the dialogue is terrible and it seems that few lines are spoken without the f-word being used .
bad script , bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad !
no way to understand the actions of kitano , or most of the other members of his family .
i could complain a lot more about this film , but why waste my time .
another poorly written script for a donkey director for no-talent offspring of past movie stars .
along three quarters of the movie , catherine just seems to be mentally retarded , poor thing .
the dialogue is so unrealistic , and their entirely insincere portrayal of it emphasizes this even more .
that is , without that one cure , substance ... something this movie has very little of .
it started off well but then it went all wrong for me .
there are few , if any , redeeming moments to be found .
great stunts , decent story , good fight scenes , but some of the action was just plain silly .
after the plane crash the movie keeps going on and on with pointless melodramatic scenes .
all of the cast members are wasted in this lackluster effort , including eddie murphy himself .
please do n't waste you 're time buying and watching this movie its totally crap .
it never transcends its influences , and is thus , in the end , generic and forgettable .
the scenery is ponderous and gaudy , the acting for the most part is terrible .
the acting , by and large , failed to transcend this directorial flatness of an idea forced into film .
anna paquin as the lead character sookie , is just awful .
the script was terrible , full of too many clich√©s , and awful one-liners .
the african location is pretty enough but that is basically all this film has going for it .
their trouble delivering lines was made even more obvious by horrible sound design .
terrible movie made on zero budget .
this is not only one of his worst but one of the most horrifying movies i 've ever seen .
plus , the whole special ability and being a hero idea is a total duplicate of x-men .
it started out well ; but , soon became boring and frankly idiotic after a while .
it 's so unintentionally funny , you have to wonder , is craven playing a joke on this ?
the acting is poor , the creatures are poor , hell , even danny trejo is poor .
do n't waste your time if you want to be entertained .
matt dillon , a fine , intense actor is totally miscast here and is stiff and mannered .
it may be notable for the first appearance of donald duck but the rest of it is mainly annoying .
one of the worst , slowest moving , dumb `` westerns '' you will ever see .
there was just no reason for me to actually care about anyone involved in the movie .
the overlong chase sequence , for example , is the least spectacular one in the history of cinema .
begrudgingly gave it a 3 - one point each for fonda , stanwyck , and the supporting cast .
the whole thing is really very dull .
first , poorly written dialogue .
i tried to find the talent they were showcasing , and it too was terrible .
i 'm very disappointed by this `` adaption '' of the famous book .
it had absolutely nothing to do with surfing .
shot almost entirely in television style close ups , this film is an insult to intelligence .
this movie is not worth sitting through ... even for nick .
if you are a parent , please avoid this like the plague .
astonishingly inept writing , direction , production , at every level , even for a tv movie .
the dialog was cheesy , the premise was stupid , and the camera work was poorly done .
the one saving grace of this character is that she is played by gillian anderson .
worst of all is the overlong ` zion rave ' scene .
my rating : 2/10 .
this is perhaps one of the worst horror films i have ever seen !
put simply this is probably the worst film i have ever seen !
i really felt bad for this guy , because he was a putrid , horrible actor .
2/10 writer , story makes no sense at all and has huge amount of flaws .
one of the worst films i 've ever seen ! .
warning : watch this movie at your own risk ! !
the cast try gamely , but are hamstrung by the screenplay , which generally makes no sense .
this is the first woody allen film i 've found not worth watching .
2 ) the `` flies '' in this movie look nothing like real flies .
well , i give it a 2 for the gore , but otherwise this film is worthless .
george clooney aims to portray mr. fox as charming and sleek , but his voice has no character .
it is the writing , acting , and direction that make this so awful .
spend your time and money elsewhere , this is not worth watching .
i thought it was funny , but as with most all comedies , it was n't that funny .
characters appear and disappear at random , and the film is loaded with pointless , confusing cutaways .
a film like this lives or dies by its effects , and quite frankly this film is dead !
amy adams gives one of the worst performances of all time .
this movie had so much potential to be good , but ultimately made nothing of it .
in my opinion it has destroyed all positive intentions of producers .
horror fans , do yourself a favor and skip out on this one .
the pacing is painfully and excruciatingly slow , that even after 40 minutes of the film nothing happens much .
next to rock-a-doodle , this is one of bluth 's worst .
the routine musical score is basically non-existent in creating any sense of mood and falls flat .
i had to feel for george zucco a talented actor who got stuck in this mess .
then it goes completely downhill and turns into a whole catalog of `` your basic slasher clich√©s '' .
the only good fight scene was between the brother and shen .
its a linear plot with no development and surprises in any way .
i 'd rather listen to jonas brothers than have to watch an episode of this ever again .
this movie was so bad , i thought i was going to scream in the middle of it .
most people wont watch it anyway so why am i wasting time writing this ?
there was no abigail crain , there was no `` companion '' , and there was no nursery .
the movie also tries to shock with explicit cursing so ... 2/10
the actors playing the main roles tried hard but charles came out looking like a social misfit .
this show appears to be a vehicle for brad garrett , who 's talents i think are very limited .
it starts good but in the middle of the movie gets boring .
i will always give good movies their due , but this movie was terrible .
the premise is just way too unique to be left alone with this uneven flick
but here , the young actress portraying the besieged daughter presented a listless performance .
this is truly one of the worst movies i 've ever seen .
why is werner herzog wasting his good talents and time with junk like this ?
only see this movie if you are desperate , or really appreciate anyone in the film .
it is so corny i can not fathom too many people actually sitting through the entire hour-and-a-half .
that brings me the most irritating track of the film - salman khan and priyanka chopra .
a weak film that starts of strong and quickly goes nowhere .
the sets are unbelievably ugly -- - and clearly a waste of millions of dollars .
terrence howard could n't even save this lame piece of work called a film .
i do n't even know why i gave this movie a rating of 2 .
all of the supporting characters were one-dimensional , and only seemed somewhat familiar with human interaction on planet earth .
do yourself a favor , change the channel when this rip off tries to disgrace your screen !
overall , not even worth a $ 1 rental .
the script is full of holes from beginning to end .
overall , the movie is boring .
chillers also features one of the worst closing theme songs ever , period .
miss davis looks like she would rather be somewhere else and has little to do .
a lot of people in the cinema enjoyed this film , but it only made me feel misanthropic .
a seemingly endless movie that really deserves a zero rating .
the screenwriter seems to be trying to portray the believers as crazy , as well .
i 'll give it to you straight : this movie is a stupid , boring waste of time .
the dialog tries to be clever and fails .
that 's what happens in a nutshell for another tired retread of the teen gross out genre .
having now wasted a glorious saturday afternoon , i feel immensely cheated .
all in all , this movie is a waste of time .
if you try to rate this as a regular movie , then this is bottom of the line drivel .
it seems john carpenter must 've known we 'd be sleeping ourselves through this movie .
subplot with the corporate law firm was a complete waste of time .
again and again , you see winters on edge and it ultimately culminates in very bad things ! !
the plot was ok but the best way to describe this movie is just plain boring .
my advice to anyone wanting to see this film : do n't waste your time .
ok , three words : worst movie ever ! ! !
in rating this from one to ten i give it a low 2 .
the story are trite , annoying , irritating , and aggravating .
the acting is bad , except for paul rudd , and donald pleasence .
the lds references were frequent and heavy-handed .
i give it `` 3 '' only because of meryl and vanessa .
for the range i was allowed , i 'll give it a 1 .
the acting was fairly decent , but james russo should stick to acting , not writing .
i am a fan of b horror , and i have certainly seen worse , much worse .
everything was so obvious , so run of the mill , so pointless .
brandy deserves better than this film , its lame script , and perverted mel .
avoid this show at all costs , it 's terrible and ridiculous .
having her play the head of the president 's secret service was a stroke of very poor casting .
it is painful to watch , worse that the worst snl skits you 've ever seen .
the power started off looking promising but soon became boring and tedious to watch .
his story is not shocking , merely self indulgent and boring .
this is a terrible movie that only gets worse and seems to never end .
live action anime without any action , or indeed any life .
i ca n't believe they do this kind of filth out of a serious theme .
there are n't any big emotional payoffs or any neat plot twists .
the dialogue , terribly stilted , is delivered by non-actors on all counts .
1- stephen baldwin does n't care about his involvement in stephen baldwin vehicles .
the inane laughing between the two main characters and the pitiful dialog made me want to cry .
what was joan crawford thinking when she accepted this incredibly bad 1937 vehicle ?
the dialogue is extremely poor and apart from karloff , the acting is really bad too .
junk , forget it , do n't waste your time etc etc
this film is a dull , shoddy mess , filled with every comic book you can think of .
the soundtrack was tedious .
the staging , color coordination and whatever else went into making this movie was alienating at best .
it is n't meant to be ambiguous and open to interpretation , it is just poorly done .
the only redeeming quality of the movie is the exquisite beauty of the leading actresses .
this is an awful re-make of the u.s. movie `` wide awake '' by the british !
well , in this awful offering , they could at least count the money they saved on sets .
this may very well be the worst movie ever made .
this is basically a ghetto version of `` road trip , '' which also sucked .
i do n't know what else to say about it but its awful .
i 've never been so disappointed in a movie in all my life .
it 's boring , implausible , poorly shot , ridiculously scripted , and lacking in cool disaster effects .
not much to say about him , besides this is a role made for him .
with a forgettable plot , painful dialog and non-existent directing , this is a waste of film .
the dialog is trite and , dare i say it again , unoriginal .
i would rather get whipped 100 times than watch this horrible piece of s**t ever again .
i found the film episodic , pointless , boring and brutal with no point of view .
fifteen minutes of plot that really did n't do much .
the dog is at best ugly , never really scary .
not much else to say about this garbled garbage .
the actors perform their lines effectively , but nothing they say or do is remotely believable .
please , do n't see this movie .
what was joan crawford thinking when she accepted this incredibly bad 1937 vehicle ?
i had never even heard of this film and perhaps for good reason -- it is awful .
it is not worth your time , except for a laugh .
and for that reason i found this movie painfully self indulgent and spiritually draining .
life is too short , > avoid avoid avoid avoid < .
the acting is horrible and the little bit of special effects is below `` b '' movie quality stuff .
i give the movie 2 out of 10 - and thats only because of rose .
it has no endearing , entertaining , or even comedic properties in comparison to it 's bad everything else .
some scenes seemed promising , playing with visual dimensions , but could n't hold up the rest .
finally , the film seemed to have no point whatsoever , expressing nothing , achieving nothing .
it is the absolute nadir in the mostly embarrassing culture of lds filmmaking .
please understand : while i admire ruth gordon 's performance , her character really , *really* irritates me .
then we get onto the human actors , and well the majority of atrocious .
the only good thing about this movie was the score but again not as good as the original .
the dialogue and delivery come straight out of a lesser 1950 's program along with the overdone physical emoting .
spoilers straight to the point , just like many other sequels , this is a woeful film .
it sounds better if you do n't have to look at this failure of super production .
just do n't go to watch it ; i request you to feel the feel of saawariya !
this one is maybe the worst movie ever made about the eternal legend of camelot and the king arthur .
samuel l. jackson narrates the thing , and really just wastes time .
it 's simply not very funny , and very little like the earlier films they 'd made .
i give it 4 because reno was so good in leon .
i do n't recommend this to anyone but the target audience .
shot badly , bad effects , worse acting .
a horrible mess of a script , crappy acting and garbage miniature effects .
the direction was the second worst part of the movie , i guess some people have no artistic vision .
after the splendor of the first film this came as a massive dissapointment .
this is far the most worst film i 've seen this year from bollywood so far .
this is a painfully boring film that has little or nothing in the way of interest .
i would not recommend this movie in any way to anyone .
this show 's nothing more than the worst slapstick .
this film had very little to offer anyone that appreciates good movies .
i spent 90 minutes of my precious life watching one of the dumbest movies i 've ever seen .
if one is interested in the films of rebane i would recommend almost any other over this .
i give it a 3 out of 10 , and then only for laughs .
the acting was watchable i 'll give it that , but the entire movie was just too out there .
i also saw this amazingly bad piece of `` anime '' at the london sci-fi festival .
everyone involved in this project is doing the worst thing they 've ever done .
some gory but silly deaths help , but the film is strictly amateur night and boring beyond belief .
i could relate to kurt , i certainly could n't relate to this `` david sloan '' .
death screams aka house of death is so bad and boring i give it 0/10 .
i have never been so disappointed in a movie character before .
the ending says it all for the whole storyline - a complete and total disappointment .
as well directed as can be expected , but basically incoherent .
i do not recommend this movie to anyone , well maybe to my enemies lol .
the soundtrack is awful and the songs are just a copy of the ones from the previous film .
there is nothing slightly humorous about a kidnapping .
bland , disappointing and sometimes even tiresome .
the acting is inept , and the plot is exactly what we 'd expect from this type of movie .
full disclosure : i hit my limit and stopped watching the movie about a half-hour into it .
the story ... the acting ... the special effects ... all fall flat ! ! !
bad directing , bad effects and the worst script in the world .
the 'plot ' , such as it is , is totally incomprehensible .
this was probably the worst movie based on a book that i 've ever seen .
harvey keitel and andie macdowell were good but some of the other actors were n't at all believable .
the 3 male leads are all annoying .
terrible special effects that tried to reach far beyond the limitations of the budget .
then there is the limp plot - about as much depth as a scooby doo cartoon .
the story is bereft of any new ideas and the phallic imagery is rather puerile .
my advice : although having a great lobby , do not waste your time and money in this crap .
the blind guy has no funny parts either , you basically have to force yourself to laugh .
i am being honest when i 'm saying that this is the worst movie i 've ever seen .
there are a couple of funny scenes but they are few and far between .
i give some low budget movies a chance , but this one started out lame .
do n't waste your time or money on this film you will be sorely disappointed .
then there 's that music ... it 's so flat and boring .
this was one of the most awful , insufferable australian movies i have ever seen .
almost all of hitchcock 's films in the 1940 's were masterpieces -- - except for this turgid potboiler .
so , aside from 3 roles played damn well this film is a big ole ' dud .
this film has nothing i like and it 's a total waste of time to look at .
please , stay away from this movie , do not waste your eyes on it .
do n't see this movie .
never seen a such a weak performance by pitt ... and the rest ?
there is n't one single sincere sounding line in the entire movie .
this one was boringly classic - there were three fights with the bad guys , following the standard procedure .
the plot and story is bad , cheesy and predictable .
and the obvious comedic pieces , i defy anybody to watch them and not sit there stone-faced .
while not the worst recent urban horror movie , there 's still nothing worth recommending here .
this film honestly has no guts , spunk , or attitude that the first film had .
this show is perhaps one of the most boring , most unfunny shows i 've ever seen .
lines that are supposed to be significant are incomprehensible .
the rest is characters walking around aimlessly and poorly rendered effects shots .
there 's not a single scary moment in this boring albeit well made hammer entry .
this has got to be one of the worst movies ever made .
i 'm a sucker for a good pirate movie , but this ai n't it .
the special effects look extremely cheap and are mostly stop-motion .
i have heard that this movie is supposed to be funny , but it 's not .
it was a cheap , quickly assembled and uninteresting knockoff of the road warrior flicks .
the flashback structure means that you know exactly who survives at the end , so there 's no suspense .
being made by sega i did n't expect much , but i also did n't expect this junk either .
the images have little to do with what story line there is , which is n't much .
although this film has had a lot of praise , i personally found it boring .
it could have worked but it just does n't .
i know humor was different back in the late 1930s , but this was just plain dumb .
all in all , i would not recommend this movie .
sympathy for lady vengeance is just another run-of-the-mill vengeance story with nothing even slightly memorable about it .
you sit there in a stupor waiting for it to get entertaining , but it never does .
the dialog is poorly written , clich√©-ridden and woodenly delivered .
i am utterly disappointed in this installment of hp !
