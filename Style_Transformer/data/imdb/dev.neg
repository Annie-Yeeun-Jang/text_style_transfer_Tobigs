the first vampires was fun , but this low budget retread makes me yawn .
there are some pretty gory scenes but the brutality here is never used to entertain .
eric freeman is truly awful as the killer of the film .
the scenes and dialog jumping around with no thought or subtlety .
but there 's no excuse for having slater stand in for bacon in this dull sequel to hollow man .
an abysmal piece of work , not to be bothered with .
not even sharon stone 's breathless performance could save this movie from itself .
aaron eckhart is guilty of over acting and over acting , over and over .
naturally , this was in order to attract young males , but it was just so cheaply done .
absolute twaddle - walt disney did that in the 1930s .
take my advice ... do not rent this film .
i gave it a `` 2 , '' only because the opening sequence was pretty well done .
it baffles me how they talked such a talented group of actors into working on this piece of rubbish .

and i 'm not one to trash a movie , but i truly believe this was awful .
this movie is just so slow it is n't even art , it is merely boring .
very poor storyline takes some blame but an abysmal screenplay kills it off .
hackneyed writing , certainly , but made even worse by the bad directing .
a story about ordinary people , none of whom are interesting and with no storyline of any interest .
the jokes were delivered without any sort of chemistry between characters which made the movie crawl by .

do not bother to watch .
this kid in the movie is not weird or even nerdy , he 's regular and boring .
the soundtrack terrible on the whole .

every scene is bathed in darkness rendering any attempt to follow the wordless story even more difficult .
the whole film was full of completely unrealistic happenings right down to the decor in her hideous apartment .
leatherface , despite his big chainsaw , is n't that menacing or memorable .
i would 've rated this movie a `` 1 , '' but it was comically bad .

very amateur and very lame .
first of all , i 'm upset there 's no choice of a `` 0 '' out of 10 .

ben affleck should stay behind the camera and continue writing scripts .
the parts that need build-up have none and time is wasted on other pointless scenes .

i love stern and love artie but do n't waste your money on this movie .
worst of all , it just seemed to go on and on and on and never go anywhere .
not only is the plot rudimentary , but the dialog is flat and stilted .

there is nothing whatsoever redeeming about this movie , unless you like mindless gore .
even the ape makeup looks second rate , which is unforgivable considering the monstrous budget of this monstrosity .
the title refers to a metaphor , but one that is so plain dumb it 's not worth repeating .
avoid this at all costs .
i like gangsta flix but this was n't even close .
i should note that the acting and cinematography were great , but that did n't help the boring script .
the script is poor , the casting very ordinary , but the dialogue and acting is just woeful .
the cinematography is poor , and the acting even more so .

i saw it yesterday , and seriously , this must be among the 10 worst movies ever made .
which makes it more of a tragedy that she was actually in a film this bad .
the direction was stylish , but it just amounts in a huge headache .
very bad film with a made-for-tv feel to it .
out of 10 but 2 ) .do n't be fooled , like i was , by first review .
some parts are okay , but i really think this movie should be avoided .
worst plot , worst acting , worst special effects ... be prepared if you want to watch this .
truly a horror to watch , and not in a good way .
the story is all over the place and none of the scenes had momentum .
not to mention a bumbling , incompetent misfit even for a ghost .
it 's obvious from production values that not much dough was wasted by showtime on this time filler .
the bottom line is the basic plot is n't at all believable and the dialog is n't any better .
this is a turgid , emotionless piece of historical fluff which should have gone straight to tv .
waste of time , resources and money .
horrid acting , terrible story , unforgivable lighting , and not one of the victims was remotely likable .
plot holes that are big enough to fall through , along with 10 other people .
the lead actress lacks the charisma and talent needed to carry a movie that focuses almost entirely on her .
this one is boring , stupid and really stuck on itself .
not one thing is funny about this movie .
kasdan 's direction and writing is too clever by half , and his characters too one-note and wooden .
simply put , not even robin williams could make this movie funny .
this movie is perhaps the worst made for tv movie i 've ever seen .
yes slater played in very bad things , but the very bad thing is this movie .
second , the motivations of the various dutch army units are baffling and never explained .
more depressing than frightening , christmas evil is one to avoid .
this was quite possibly the worst movie i have ever seen .
there was nothing in this movie to make me want to see anything else made by these people again .
this came at the end of a long weekend spent watching really bad films .
i remember watching this film back in 86 ' when it first came out & what an awful film .
this is probably the worst movie ever made , the worst about it is that it 's norwegian .
please , i implore you , avoid this flick !
it goes on forever but is so tedious .
van dien 's character clearly tries to be indiana jones and fails so badly it 's not even funny .
this movie could only be interesting to someone who is conducting an anthropological study of 1980s pop culture .
i do n't mind it when it 's there for a purpose : here it service no purpose whatsoever .
fay dunaway and brenda vaccaro are the only real reasons to watch this movie .
the ending when mary finally meets the one responsible for her suffering is embarrassingly awful .
this one is simply stupid and not very funny at all .
i would give this a `` 0 '' if it were possible .
i normally laugh at slapstick but this was n't funny .
the entire landing procedure was so bad i wanted to puke .
it 's a lousy script with crappy characters and really naff acting and direction .
avoid this movie at all costs unless you want to see some decent actors give horrible performances .
this turgid celluloid clunker is something i will soon forget .
real insipid , superficial gay junk movie .
yet another appalling screenplay that is far more painful than any brutality inflicted on screen .
the story is difficult to follow , the acting is bad , the camera-work is uninspired .
the worst film i have seen in the last 12 months .
paul rudd an actor who normally can do no wrong also was in this dud .
unconvincing acting ruins what might have been rather good dialogue .
i love the original from 1953 so i recommend you to go and rent that one instead .
in 99.9 % of the movie she looked extremely out of place , out of everything ! !
the movie could not even produce a single laugh or smile .
despite the mysteriously positive reviews and high rating , this is an awful movie .
this is going on my list of the worst of 2009 .
george lopez , leave this off your resume there george .
if you respect your brain , please avoid this piece of **** at all costs .
the only thing redeemable about the film is kristen scott thomas .
this really was a one off .
bad directing and terrible editing combine to make this the worst film i have seen this year .
tom 's character was really awful , horrible script .
i rarely ever see a sci-fi film i absolutely think is this bad .
one to avoid unless it 's very cheap & your very bored .
the rest of the men are one-dimensional characters without nuance , the way they often appear in romance novels .
of all movies , this is the worst movie i have ever seen .
sorry , richard , but you need to stay on strike as this script is atrocious !
i 've never seen a tv pilot show this bad .
even though chevy chase was in this movie , he was n't funny .
the whole story is constantly being bombarded with sub-plots , character introduction and meaningless pieces information that go nowhere .
the only remotely funny part is the rocker with the black teeth getting all the girls .
but not in any comical manner ; it 's just sadly humorous .
the jokes , if you could call them that , were so predictable as to be pathetic .
i know this film is directed towards teenage girls but they deserve better films than this .
simply put , the worst film i 've ever seen .
but much worst is the directing style that is terribly boring .
do n't watch it - it 's pure propaganda and its pure wrong ...
please do n't waste your time and money on this .
this movie is totally unredeemable , and lacks social value .
i had a very hard time sitting through this film .
jason alexander is passable , but that wig has to go and i saw better dancing in bugsy malone .
you wo n't even get any laughs out of the utter ineptitude on display ... trust me .
the holes in the logic of this movie are big enough to lose the mir space station in .
there are many good early talkies but this is not one of them .
this earns no more than a 3 on a scale of 10 .
all the chases that follow are this film 's version of the tiresome car chases of many movies .
basically the only really interesting and good character is the hit-man played by the always dependable max von sydow .
all i can do is laugh at this corny crap !
all in all , i would avoid this at all costs .
i ca n't begin to describe how disappointed i was sitting through this movie .
a very bad attempt at a young spinal tap .
even copying other two great successful movies this one is really pathetic .
the direction is awful , the production values just dreadful , the acting non-existent , and the pace sluggish .
the characters are n't particularly involving , either the `` good guys '' or the `` bad guys . ''
f i could give this a zero i would .
she was supposed to be beautiful as well as deadly , but she was very unattractive .
the only good thing is the cinematography and the cutter 's job .
the only good thing about this movie is the idea of this t.v .
do n't waste your time watching this ugly excuse for a movie .
in this movie the protagonist is so transparent and incompetent that it leaves the story in shambles .
but really , chase has done better than this , as have farrah fawcett and george wendt .
so while we may like augusta and think she 's funny , she ca n't anchor the story .
nothing redeeming , no lessons taught - nothing uplifting in any way .
direction in terms of shots and angles is reasonable , but in terms of actors it 's lousy .
it 's not even a scary horror movie and the acting is so stiff - where was the director ?
hancock and jefferson were the only bearable characters in the whole movie .
the characters are undeveloped and the viewer is hard-pressed to find anything to sympathize with them .
it tries for frankness , but the connection between the characters just never catches spark .
strike three : while cheerleader massacre does have some nudity , , the murders are relatively bloodless .
if you like to see really really bad movies ... this one is for you .
the plot does n't engage because we do n't really care about the rancid little protagonists .
he is not funny or enlightening or remotely interesting .
i really wanted to like this movie , but i just could n't .
a very simple story with amateur casting can not impress me like this ever .
this story is full of holes , of pieces that do n't really fit , of loose ends .
all in all this film was an awful waste of my time and money !
`` chupacabra terror '' is one of the worst b-horror movies ever made .
this is pure crap , and probably the worst biblical theme film ever ...
the characters and reactions unconvincing .
instead of character development , we get bloated , boring , gory battle scenes .
i have never , ever seen a movie that was actually more predictable and drenched with stereotypes .
especially `` b '' horror movies from the 80 's but this one simply has nothing to offer .
perhaps the worst crime of all in this movie is the sheer tedium .
so , this is the worst movie you will probably ever see .
this is the worst troma movie i have ever seen and i normally love troma films .
this is the worst movies i have ever seen .
the character really was dumb and that was all , the dumb humor was all that had me watching .
boring , bloodless , unfunny .
chuck norris is a terrible actor .
features probably the worst acting of any film in recent memory .
as if that were not bad enough , this film is very dated and boring .
dialogues are horrible , and aishwarya 's pronunciation of urdu words is absolutely revolting .
the tone of the film has a curious madcap quality that i found more irritating than fun .
what makes it even worse it the fact that not one of these repeated jokes are funny .
this is the worst movie i 've seen in 5 years , probably since 'the avengers ' .
bottomline is that for someone who is studying film this movie is a complete waste of time and money .
patrick stewart must have been hard up for money to add his name to this rubbish !
none of the actors have any chemistry with one another .
in fact , its so bad i was predicting which kid would make what shot in the basketball game .
the story is silly , the kids are terrible actors and one of them is incredibly obnoxious .
it is not funny at all and is both boring and irritating .
andre really did n't do much , so in a way it was more like a 2 on 1 .
now thanks to this movie i have and wish i had n't : the whole thing is extremely boring .
i am a kind person , so i gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1 .
one of the most boring unexpected meteor shower scenes ever .
here 's an indie film i really wanted to like , but ultimately could not .
this film was choppy , incoherent and contrived .
i gave it a 1 because i have never seen such a bad movie .
okay , this is definitely the dumbest movie i 've ever seen since satan 's school for girls .
the acting is just as awful hearing the movie in spanish as it is in english .
do n't watch this .
the film has nothing to offer and is random hatred and aggression dressed up as pretentious art .
no really good plot , neither an espionage flick nor a romantic love story .
in particular lord byron , her sometime lover , is presented as a poorly researched caricature .
he really try 's to make a good movie , but he just ca n't do it .
first off the people that did the casting must have been asleep whilst doing so .
the movie was predictable & there was no originality .
this was possibly the biggest waste of 99 cents that i can imagine .
what can i say , a very unfunny flick , uninteresting flick , with lousy actors .
i gave a nightmare on elm street part five a one out of ten .
surely no saturday morning tv kids ' show was ever done this poorly .
i did n't laugh once through its entire run , nor even come close to cracking a smile .
the director fails to take his protagonists seriously , therefore we are not touched by their problems and conflicts .
this movie was painful to sit through and offers nothing of any real merit whatsoever .
the cinematography is poor , the music sucks & the entire film looks dubbed , badly dubbed too .
the story drug on , almost endlessly , with lack of action .
the acting is wooden , stiff , and heartless .
a boring wreck of a film , and a terrible waste of the talents of some usually excellent actors .
the music 's all wrong , too - it 's bland action stuff that actually detracts from the tension .
a film about absolutely nothing , populated by exceedingly boring , uninteresting characters .
the aunt farting scene is n't particularly funny , just incredibly childish .
pedantic , overlong fabrication which attempts to chronicle the birth of the federal bureau of investigations .
& stiggs , at all costs .
avoid this garbage like the plague .
it is supposed to be a thriller , eventually aesthetically it is just disgusting .
the acting is so poor it makes voodoo academy seem like gone with the wind .
i ca n't believe tv had the guts to show this drivel .
they simply are not funny to me and made this short quite the chore to sit through indeed .
character development is jettisoned in favour of a nuts and bolts plot which delivers few pleasures .
the characters are just too uninteresting too , no matter who is playing them .
the only redeeming factor is angie harmon .
he gives a total crap performance , that bores you to death .
because of the beautiful visuals , i give it a 2 out of 10 .
the story is simply uninteresting and indulgent .
sure , we got in free , but we still want to bill eddie murphy for wasting our evening .
it 's so monumentally stupid , so full of absurd situations and characters that it beggars rational criticism .
i barely laughed , and the original version was in my eyes an utterly forgettable movie .
first of all , it is boring , the prelude is too long when literally nothing happens .
the only redeeming qualities of this flick are the marginal splatter effects .
a few good moments , but does little to educate and little to really entertain .
predictable plot , boring belushi , and possibly the worst kid actor of all time .
basically it stinks start to finish .
not funny - how can anyone link this to monty python ?
it 's almost impossible for me to put into words how bad this movie is .
there are subtleties in the plot that are shaved away and never explained satisfactorily , which hurts this film .
if this comes on tv , do n't waste your time .
i really , really tried to think of something that would merit rating this higher than a two .
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen .
everything here reeks of mediocrity , including connery 's bad toupee .
the direction was poor , the acting was mediocre and the writing was amateurish .
i would definitely call this the worst movie of all time .
it 's a conglomeration of pointless scenes that do n't make up a story .
stilted acting , a leading man who looks like he 's sleepwalking , and alison eastwood embarrassing herself .
i slept through many parts of the movie simply because it is so dull .
why is this one of the most unconvincing depictions of a movie set i have ever seen ?
needless to say , the plot does n't really go anywhere and the overall effect is really rather dull .
it 's ugly stuff because the values , the ideals , of the screenplay are all so harmful .
unfortunately , the story is thrown off kilter by awful acting and characters you just ca n't care about .
there is very little here by which i could recommend cult , do n't bother with this one .
there is not a single sympathetic character in this entire movie .
that and deborah richter 's nudity are why i give it a 3 instead of a zero .
the marsh is truly a movie bogged down by its own script .
this is just a stupid , stupid movie , with the culprit being the terrible script .
this movie is the worst i 've seen in the last 5 years .
jeanette 's singing is the only thing that saved me from complete boredom .
some of the split screen stuff worked well too , but ultimately the plot went nowhere .
the first 20 minutes of the original film were pretty good but it was all downhill from there .
poor acting , a messy story and all too sixties in film quality .
if that was what was intended , date movie fails on all counts .
this movie had very little good points , the special effects and acting was horrible for sure .
several scenes go by and there 's no work , no rehearsals ... nothing .
those movies were entertaining in their awfulness but this pile of dinosaur dung is so bad its painful .
this work of `` fiction '' is nothing more than propaganda to bring hate among white people .
very long delay in much of anything happening .
the middle is so incredibly lacking in feel and scare factor , i was bored to death .
salman khan was tolerable in the above mentioned movies , but here he is insane .
but his sullen , brooding hamlet is a one-note prince , and a pretty tedious note at that .
unintentionally funny & painfully dumb .
i 've seen `` goosebumps '' episodes that were scarier than this horrid home video footage .
the animation is awful , whatever happened to shows that made decent attempts in detailed drawings ?
and for lord and lady 's sake , do n't rent this sucker .
this is the type of movie that gives hollywood blockbusters a bad name .
i loved the original , i thought 2 was the best , i tolerated 3 .
barring that big bad wolf is another example of low-grade movie making in the horror genre .
but the way in which it is presented i have to give it a 1/10 .
but the true uninteresting , even irritating characters are the main ones : the two girls .
there are so many logical errors in this show it 's barely worth me stating .
the plot is predictable at best and ludicrous at its worst .
its just that the show is unrealistic and the way he handles things makes me just squirm .
believe that john cusak had a hand in the writing and producing of this mess .
i would give this a `` 0 '' if it were possible .
one of the troma 's worst films .
if the rest of the series continues like this , i 'll be sorely let down .
it 's dull , unexciting , and a major waste of time .
this was one of the worst movies that i have ever watched .
three immature young people have sex and talk about very little except their `` love '' of each other .
typical `` mafia '' behavior was boring and stereotypical .
it reminded me of the worst excesses of 60 's french new wave .
absolutely unimaginative and absolutely absurd and absolutely boring from the beginning to the end .
i am thankful that so few other people were subjected to this waste of celluloid .
the characters are flat .
do n't waste your time , money or anything at all on this piece of `` film '' .
i ca n't say i 've ever seen a movie this badly directed or a worse story line .
the characters are not likable at all either .
it seems that the creators of this film just had an idea ... .and that 's all .
i 'm giving it a 2 instead of a 1 because i like benigni .
truly , it 's an insult to aaliyah fans as well .
i give this movie 1 star out of 10 .
the dialogue is dumb or non-existent ; the flying sequences are okay but pretty repetitive .
the plot is weak the acting is bad and the science is worse .
there 's very few gore , dreadful attempts to bring insert humor and truly annoying character drawings .
unintentional laughs : few .
do n't waste your time on this clunker ... . go read the book .
john travolta , lisa kudrow , and ed o'neil could not save this money .
they take quotes from witness testimonies out of context 4 .
brando was good as a german officer but the rest of the film was simply unbearable .
it 's a very , very , very bad soap opera .
there was only one time where i did jump but other than that , it was n't scary .
in a related note , sctv star andrea martin has one funny scene .
action scenes were thrown in at random intervals which made no sense in the context of the movie .
a farcical comedy with irresistible leads quite often hits the mark but is n't for one second believable .
i cant stress enough that this film should be avoided at all costs .
otherwise , do n't waste your time the feelings between father and son are never explained .
my tv guide gave this movie 3 ticks and described it as a `` gritty police thriller '' .
full of clich√©s and one-liners , it is one of the cheapest ww2 movies i 've seen .
`` after the first 5 minutes there is nothing worth watching in this film '' .
the quality of this work is also just so very bad to view ... shot on dv ? ? ?
we know from other movies that the actors are good but they can not save the movie .
only saving grace of this movie is the cinematography .
so , i went into this with sensible expectations ; and unfortunately , found only boredom .
suffice to say the plot is abominable and destroys the whole film .
shot on very cheap video , it looks like a high school project , but without the emotion .
buckley is the only reason to sit through this disaster .
moriarty gives his lousiest performance ever and even agutter 's gorgeous eyes ca n't save this mediocre movie .
if you 're going to use a tired plot , you need to do better than this .
by far the worst part of `` raptor island '' is the animation of the raptors .

i give this movie a 4 cause i 'm a die hard fan of the video game series .
as it is , evil altar is a deadly boring film that could have been good if directed properly .

this is polanski 's worst film by a wide margin .
what was andrew dice clay thinking when he decided to film this inexcusable piece of garbage .
i could go on for many lines , but this abysmal movie is just not worth wasting the time .

first of all , i 'm upset there 's no choice of a `` 0 '' out of 10 .
the movie has no really interesting or even surprising turning points , no good acting or thrilling music .
this is by far the most awful movie i have ever seen .
poor jane austen ought to be glad she 's not around to see this dreadful wreck of an adaptation .
not really even acceptable enough to rate as an average film of its kind , therefore : 4/10
this is possibly the worst movie i have ever seen .
this is called extreme movie , just that fact should be enough to make you stay away .
but watching this is even more painful , especially because it is as predictable as it can get .
this is a totally pointless remake of the 40 year old tv series that launched julie christie .
the shark attacks with all the aplomb of a bored movie star .
the potential for a good story is there , but this movie never comes close to delivering .
the acting is all over the maps , the camera work is average , the music just okay .
the characters do n't have any personality or relevance .they just appear , they walk .and they die .
all his characters in this movie were so unlikable and i could care less .
the sets are boring as are the characters and the dialogue .
the characters had zero development beyond them being introduced .
it ranks as one of the worst gay films i have ever seen .
not the worst i 've seen , but this was still extremely bad !
as beautiful as the story and images are , the plot is awfully unrealistic and highly contrived .
i like most of the american comedies , but this is n't good at all .
so many bad movies land on my desk and i actually sit through all of them .
and the film is riddled with one hackneyed scene like this after another .
there was no chemistry between the leads , the kisses looked like something i traded with my grandmother .
catherine mccormack also plays a very irritating character .
it 's just that the lion 's share of the characters come off as unsympathetic .
and all the time wasted on chasing a guy on a bike , then drop him from a helicopter .
the plot was terrible and unbelievable .
very little of it makes any sense , so what good special effects there are , are basically wasted .
all in all , just an extremely run of the mill unoriginal plot .
overall the film is not worth ten minutes of your time let alone another 48 hours .
i ca n't even believe that they made and aired this junk .
this under-developed script left its ' actors no choice but to perform badly .
here she is totally one-dimensional character , and the lines gave to her are mostly embarrassingly shallow .
this little movie is like a nacho 's commercial : bad storyline , bad directing , and awful performances .
it was building up to be a great movie , but then i saw the villain and was disappointed .
the historical angle works fine , but the dialog is absolutely horrible .
not exactly the best horror film film ever , but miles and miles from the worst .
totally uninvolving , slow , tedious and detached .

this is the kind of movie that has the potential to turn people off to westerns .
worse than anything is that the actors made some of the ugliest drag queens i 've ever seen .
the plot was non-existent , the acting was poor , the effects were poor ...

do not watch this movie .

all of the story is told through painfully dull narration .
even for a t & a movie , this one is a turkey .
the characterization and acting were generally acceptable in this movie but the script let them down .
all in all a mediocre book made in to a abysmal movie .
do n't waste your life .
the limited scenery views were the only saving grace to an otherwise uneventful and boring movie .
very important elements , which made the whole thing plausible are just written out or changed to bad .
the sound and music were terrible , even below standards for independent productions on shoestring budgets .
it seems like you 've stumbled onto the worst dubbing job of all time .
but the film uses such poor dialouge that it never came across clearly during the screening .
despite a few humorous and borderline surreal moments , it was very slow moving and actually depressing .
this low-budget film is fun if you 're a john krasinski fan , but is otherwise disappointing .
the musical score is very meaningless , it does n't bring any tension or badness in the movie .

as painful as any fight scene ever recorded .

go for quality movies and steer clear of this mistake .
characters were not explored , and aspects of the location and politics were ignored .
but this assortment are n't so much the dirty dozen - more like the unconvincing foursome .
four stars for `` hamlet '' ; three , yes three for the mst3k version .
the direction is not horrible or distracting in anyway , but it is just painfully mediocre .
stallone 's constant , supposedly sly , cocky grins destroy any sense of suspense .
actually , more words come to mind : ridiculous , third-rate , and terrible .
if you 're looking for a movie that will make you laugh , steer clear from this abomination .

not scary at all .
denver pyle also had to live this one down , especially after appearances in so many great westerns .
the circular meandering plot is frustrating .
it has barely any laughs , and it wastes its lavish production values .
this movies is probably best to avoid if you experience seizures .
characters are killed off left and right in ludicrous pointless ways .

for the first time , i gave a 1 out of 10 rating to british mini-series .
it uses shaky camera motions and cutaways instead of real technique or any inspired moves .
it is genuinely shocking that hollywood was able to produce a film this utterly inept and mindless .
i could n't stand but 30 minutes of this swill .
the actions of the female lead and that of her brother , the cop , also make no sense .
salma hayek is gorgeous but she and pierce brosnan have zero chemistry .
this must be one of the worst movies of all time .
if this movie were n't so bad it would be laughable , but there 's nothing funny about it .
scenes do n't make sense from second to second , and the connections between them are nonexistent .

there are some exciting scenes in this movie but in general it is second-rate .
this was one of the most predictable films i have ever seen .
i was hopeful that the end would bring a satisfying solution , but it did not .

no point , no fun , no originality ; just a few cheap bucks for the film makers .
i usually am a big fan of the red stuff , but here is was just cheesy and nasty .
it is amazing that a film called mole people could be as static and uninteresting as this one was .

awful special effects - middle school quality .

rob zombie is a brilliant horror writer , so if you are squeamish , please stay away !
these are placed in the middle of a series of scenes that are simply excruciating to sit through .
terrible film , terribly overacted , terrible over-used plot .
if you watch it after this review , its your own fault !
my vote is three .
some of the scenes were funny , but it amounted to probably only 5 mins of the whole duration .
weak acting and very predictable .
i have nothing else to share on `` blood lake '' except the message : do not watch it .
adding to the frustration is that these `` cannibals '' are compared exactly to vampires !

well if that idea does n't intrigue you , which it should n't , stay away from ringmaster .
do n't bother with this even if you are a fan of 70 's exploitation cinema .
high school productions are better than this and the actors involved should erase this from their resume .
i always liked adrian paul , but how on earth did this film ever see the light of day ?
it 's horribly acted , horribly written , and it just is plain bad !
mira sorvino 's portrayal of a queen playing a young male scholar was depressing at best .
no mummies , no curse and not a whole lot of action or excitement .
bob hastings as the aforementioned phantom looks and acts and speaks in the most absurd manner .
there was n't a likable character and that is the fault of everyone responsible for making it .

i could only take so much before it became truly unappealing .
it has two or maybe three jokes that might get a bored person to smile and ... nothing .
total acting skills displayed by all participants : close to zero .
the acting , camera-work , plot , script , and sound are all awful .
most of the suite , although is surprisingly good for a no-name composer , is mostly unoriginal and uninspired .
what a complete waste of a great original storyline .
thumbs down on this big fat turkey .
she showed promise only once in this `` gypsy '' and that was with `` rose 's turn . ''
battle scenes are a mess too , with no geography between cuts .
avoid at all costs .
if it was n't for these two guys i would have rated this film 2/10 instead of 4/10 ...
i gave it a four cos there were some good effects .
this is the lowest common denominator film making and it is about as unfunny as a heart attack .
if you are planning on watching it , suffice to say - do n't .
i give it `` 3 '' only because of meryl and vanessa .
there are no strong points and nothing positive to say .
do not , i repeat , do not watch this film when it 's shown on american movie classics .
i will never watch this movie again nor will i recommend this movie to anyone .
add to that all the other `` z '' movie elements , and you have a classic turkey .
besides her nice shapely figure this movie was just utterly wasted .
if you like matt le blanc , do n't watch it .
the editing is simply dreadful and times and it becomes even laughable bad in certain sequences .
if you like awful films like i do you might find it strangely fascinating ... the musical numbers especially .
watch at your own risk .
none of these flaky people even remotely gain our sympathy for an instant .
the script is unbelievably slow and 3/4 of the movie seem to serve as filler .
the 3 replacement actors do n't seem to know martial arts at all .
random clich√©s such as `` innocent until proved guilty '' randomly uttered by cast .
if you are looking for something beyond that , this movie was empty .
the only neat thing about this movie are the electric planes .
to conclude : file under `` forgettable nonsense '' .
the `` suspenseful '' plot was bad .
its painfully unfunny and i do n't know how it lasted for 2 seasons .
there 's no tension and the storyline is extremely thin .
the `` gravy robbers '' is one of the dumbest sketches i ever saw .
overall , `` severed '' is a failed attempt at what could have been a decent b-movie .
normally , that 's a good thing , but the music here is honestly terrible .
lots of horrible scenes and horrible acting and this movie is not funny at all .
however all in all this is a watchable movie , just do n't expect and compare with matrix .
one of the worst romantic comedies i 've ever seen .
do n't waste your time .
this film also contains the worst fight scene i have ever seen .
but because of its supreme shallowness and total escapism , it tanks tremendously to a 1/10 .
the plot has nothing to do with the first and the whole movie stinks ! ! !
lucy lawless must have needed a payday very badly to sign up for this opus .
a movie with gags so bad , that they are n't funny at all .

etc , etc , etc ... one could write about how stupid this thing is for a long time .
every waking moment in front of the tv , this horrid video played .

even more blatant are john hodiak as a gangster and wendell corey as his insanely jealous torpedo .
this movie was agonizing to sit through .
she may be able to cook but it is not portrayed in this half-hour stomach churning painful production .
i wanting to drown in my beer at the horrible one liners reggie was given in this one .

i could n't finish watching it , and usually i like watching all kinds of b-movies .
the movie started with a flashback within a flashback within a flashback , and just got worse from there .
the concept is good , but the storytelling is flimsy .
no comic book , least of all fantastic four , has ever featured a villain so obscenely one dimensional .
the story itself is rather tiresome , only occasionally coming to life because of fontaine 's spirited heroine .
naturally , there 's also a chase through the woods guided by the obligatory banjo music and incompetent cinematography .
it was just the incredibly slow story , one hour 15 minute material stretched for nearly two hours .
the dialogue in wes craven 's section also felt very forced and the chinatown story was completely incomprehensible .
the lines delivered were spoken as if the actors had no motivation for being there .
and the glacial pace of this drama makes it almost painful to sit through .
the acting is horrible and the little bit of special effects is below `` b '' movie quality stuff .
this is a perfect example of what not to do when making a sequel to an already great movie .
without any redeeming qualities , i did n't care about what happened to any of them .
other than some neat special effects , this movie has nothing to offer .
self-indulgent to the extend and not a funny moment in this 8 minute short .
there are some strong and pleasing sketches but the rest are clich√©d .
i strongly recommend you save your money and do not go and see this movie .
the script was unoriginal and predictable , reminding me of a story a 6th grader might write .
what was once an amazing television series has been tainted by a terribly unfunny film .
to add to that , the script and the animation is peppered with annoying sloppiness .
the plot is confusing and has more holes than all the golf courses at myrtle beach .
but with `` christine '' the jokes are just insipid .
plot developments are also very slow .
i did n't read any reviews and tried to watch this unintentionally humorous film .
most of the f/x are not very convincing and the movie takes on a cheap teen slasher theme .
the sexually salty activities filtered in just never convince and are far from erotic .
no money , bad dialog , and a slow , boring , pointless plot .
no tension , very little blood , and not much violence on screen .
madonna 's character , nikki , is annoying and obnoxious .
stay away from this movie .
this sequel completely ignores the continuity of the jason legend that had been meticulously built up over the years .
poor david morse , he 's a tremendous actor , but given nothing to do here .
well , i have a layman 's knowledge of roman history and even i found the inaccuracies flagrant .
sandra bullock plays essentially a bit part , completely unnecessary to the plot .
the editing was horrid , the dialogue was horrid , and the music montages were too often .
strongly avoid , unless you really dig bad movies and film-making .
the story is flat - it leaves you emotionless the entire movie .
william macy may be one of our greatest living actors , but here he 's put to little use .
soylent is enjoyable to watch , but the whole screenplay is a joke .
i suppose that he 's not supposed to be a street cop , but it 's still inexcusable .
it 's not about the plot , but the plot is so weak .
quite seriously , i wanted to commit suicide after i saw this miserable peice of crud .
if your morbidly curious as to how bad this movie is , please do n't make me describe it .
i loved the original movie , and this one was not worthy of being its sequel .
i 've always thought that cinderella ii was the worst movie i 've ever seen , .
the movie purports to be sci-fi but the plot is confusing and unrealistic even for sci-fi standards .
all in all , the movie is a near total washout .
dreadful score , the direction is very amateurish , and the acting is well below average .
in conclusion , do not see this movie .
basically everyone in the story but vera is a one-note stereotype .
i am a very big fan of jenna jameson , but this movie is horrible .
poor acting , stereotype dialog , massively improbable behaviour , this movie lacks of nearly anything .
this is a worthless sequel to a great action movie .
please do not waste one moment of your time watching this `` film '' .
i am amazed , simply amazed that people would work so hard to make something so stupid .
this is by far one of the most pretentious films i have ever seen .
full of holes , with awful sequencing .
just bad all around , a huge `` jaws '' rip-off and not a good one at that .
not compelling and uninteresting from the open to credits .
none of the characters are appealing , the main character is totally unsympathetic .
what we are left with is a truly strange mish-mash of genres that must have embarrassed everyone involved .
watson is barely in this one -- he adds almost nothing to the story line .
the concept of the story is reasonable , but the concept is all that is delivered .
not laughter , not enjoyment , but absolute depression .
the acting is terrible especially the scene where he stays at lois 's house for the night .
save your money and precious time out of your life by avoiding this movie like the black plague .
the dominatrix is n't sexy or whatsoever .
there is no plot , no tension , no characters , and not a lot of acting .
absolutely the worst filming of a great musical ever .

i usually love b list movies and such , but this one ...
in short , this film is an insult to the better films by argento , fulci , et all .

little grace or charm , little action , little point to the whole thing .
the only good thing about this film is the nubile sophie marceau who is frequently fairly naked .
the characters were poorly written and for the most part they were totally unsympathetic except for gus .
wow , i do n't know where to begin with describing this laborious and completely unfunny travesty .
there is nothing to motivate the audience , this is entirely dull and a complete waste .
ashley rose orr made possibly the worst on-screen shirley .
the movie is formulaic and extremely predictable , with an ending you may see coming a mile away .
the character 's are truly awful & i did n't believe any of them were actual human beings .
terrible movie , even for the genre .
after the excellent land before time 3 , this fourth film comes as a disappointment .
boring story , bland dialogue , dull action scenes , no real characters etc .
my take : yet another lame pg-13 horror movie with predictable scare tactics and a derivative plot .
the characters are extremely underdeveloped , both from the script and the wooden acting .
how can a concept holding so much horrific potential result in such a boring and incoherent mess ?
the movie also tries to shock with explicit cursing so ... 2/10
all in all , t 's just plain boring .
i was totally appalled by this movie and only finished watching it because i was a kickboxer movie fan .
this sounds pretty funny , but it is n't .

keanu is good at acting confused , and that 's about all he does in this film .
try as i might , i just ca n't stand these pictures -- they just are n't funny .
a loser in the first season of american idol , a horrible actor on screen .

akshay kumar was good as always and that was the only good thing about the movie .
even with the jokes of joel , crow and the others , nothing could make this turkey fly .
damn it , the effect of the moving hand is the best feature about this cheapie mess .
this is beyond a shadow of a doubt the absolute worst movie i have ever seen .
the manuscript is awful , the directing even worse and the acting is plain despicable .

the only remotely good bit about this was a brief cameo by johnny depp .
also , the shot ... oh my god the shots , just awful !
in the end , i found this boring movie a complete mess and waste of time .
poor horror recommended only for real fans ... other people would hate it .
also mixing dead teenage girls and sex as if it 's funny is in very questionable taste .
promising idea ruined by an unfunny script and terrible acting .
for such a high profile and well respected group of actors the performances are exceptionally bad .
no story , no plot , nothing .
poor shooting , directing , editing , script , dvd transfer , etc .
for bad movie lovers only , all others please avoid this at all costs .

the plot is ridiculous , the script is dreadful , the acting dire and the special effects are laughable .
one more gripe : the stylized animation , although meant to be hip just seemed unappealing .
we would return it , but do n't no if anybody would want this stupid movie .
this story had so many holes in it you could drive an oil tanker through each of them .
it plays like a tv episode instead of a movie , and the acting is very stilted .
the only plus side to their performance is their dominance over the script that fails to evoke any comedy .

i kept waiting for something to happen after the opening scenes , and it never did .
fall time also features the world 's least believable sex scene .
overacting , a trite script , distracting voice-over , two dimensional characters and editing out of film 101 .

this must be , hands down , the most gruesome pretense of a movie ever ...
the cast all look awkward and the jokes are forced and unfunny .
except for tia carrere , there really is n't anything to see here .
you never root for him , because he has nothing to accomplish .
no plot , no clear storyline , just some misplaced suspense .
this movie had no story and failed to get my interest !
direction and other technical aspects are not important and not worth mentioning .
this poor imitation of a movie was made in 1948 .
the story is unimaginative and unremarkable .
the movie is all over the place and totally incoherent .
with the exception of the acting of close and gyllenhaal , the whole film feels like a hack job .

the worst thing was the ending , with a dull , dull car chase that did n't go anywhere .
this is by far the most awful movie i have ever seen .
i want the 99 minutes of my life back that was wasted on this pathetic excuse for a movie .

avoid at all costs .
these random musical numbers felt like they came out of some particularly bad gilbert and sullivan operetta .
the story is poorly written and very uninteresting .
this is dull entertainment , destruction for the lover of brute force .
this process makes for some lush tableaux , but ultimately it 's a facile exercise .
next , many of the musical numbers are the most corniest ever directed which drags the film down tremendously .
literally every element of this film is abysmal in ways i do not have the capacity to describe .

huge historical mistakes : the screenplay by gore vidal is notorious for inaccuracies .
any character development at all that was made in the first movie was completely undermined .

first , it truly ridicules the awful cultural phenomenon known as `` reality television '' .
the plot had possibility , but once someone started writing the screenplay for this , it was all downhill .
i could not identify with or care about any of the characters .
it 's a low-budget , badly written , piece of pointless garbage .

but even more shocking is the uncharacteristically bad script penned by wes craven and his son , jonathan craven .
this story could have been quite funny , but it 's too unpleasant .
that character stays true , and that 's why this film gets a 3/10 .
do n't waste your time and money to rent this .
even with a cast that has some comedic talent the jokes that commence are tired .

where `` elizabeth i '' had gravitas , `` the tudors '' is deadly dull .
the stereotypical intellectually catatonic leftist : lazy , smug , gullible , unable to learn .
the special effects have no effect whatsoever - except inducing complete disbelief .
if it 's a drama , there was no tension and the underlying message appears muddled .
it ranks as one of the worst gay films i have ever seen .
another `` ishtar '' in that i kept waiting for it to get better , which never happened .
joe taking off in the car and leaving wagner stranded , makes him even more unlikeable .
it is amateur hour really and a very expensive waste of great actors like jacobi and guinness .
about the only thing i liked was the portrayal of dr vic by the jack nicholson lookalike actor .
as mentioned , burt reynolds ' stiff and lifeless charlie detracts from his already unlikeable character even further .

i guess everybody was naughty this year ... that is the only explanation for releasing this piece of punishment !
bad all the way through , so bad it was torn to pieces on mystery science theater 3000 .
there is nothing remotely funny or entertaining to be found in this lame attempt to make people laugh .
the action does n't thrill , and the characters are developed through egregious one-liners and clich√© events .
the dialog and things the people do just is n't believable .
so don¬¥t get fooled by the propaganda , and be aware if this boring kitty hits your town .
all his characters in this movie were so unlikable and i could care less .
this movie is totally ridiculous , the plot is disgusting and completely without logic .
the characters themselves were , to a person , unlikeable ; i did n't care what happened to them .
as a life-long trek fan , i am so disappointed with this series !

badly scripted , with inane and wooden dialogue .
bad acting , bad directing , bad writing and idiotic battle sequences .
terrible plot , awful acting .
the worst part of this movie is how talented the cast is in everything else they 've appeared in .
though the quality of the acting was good overall , the content of the film was appalling .
i 'll never watch or buy any film directed by this heartless monster .
this movie is really just an incessant cell phone ringing and someone picking it up looking harried and worried .
it was just the boring made-for-tv caliber you 're used to seeing on lifetime .
my advice is to avoid this show like the plague .
add to that the seemingly inept direction of lamberto bava and you 've got one stinker of a movie .
this movie makes canadians and brits out to be asinine , moronic idiots .
what i was n't prepared for is that it 's also witless , unfunny and boring .

from the creators of apex & just as bad ...
characters are killed off left and right in ludicrous pointless ways .
the director fails to take his protagonists seriously , therefore we are not touched by their problems and conflicts .
allan joslyn is not too entertaining and we could have done without him .
this film does not even deserve a 1/10 it is that bad .
all done without any dynamic to the scenes or interesting fx .
